	abstract = {Whether the Dirac sea model is right is verifiable. Assuming the Dirac sea is a physical reality, we have one imagination that a negative energy particle(s) in the sea and a usual positive energy particle(s) will form a neutral atom. The features of the atom can be studied using the nonrelativistic reduction of the Bethe-Salpeter equation, especially for a two body system. This work is dedicated to discuss the bound state of spin-0 and spin-\${\textbackslash}frac\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle 1\}\{{\textbackslash}displaystyle 2\}\$ constituents. The study shows that an atom consisting of a negative energy particle \$(e{\textasciicircum}-\$ or \$hc)\$ and a positive energy particle \$(u{\textbackslash}overline\{d\}\$ or \$hc)\$ has some features of a neutrino, such as spin, lepton number and oscillation. One deduction is that if the atom is a real particle, an atom \$X\$ consisting of two negative energy particles and a nucleus with double charges exists in nature, which can be observed in Strangeonium, Charmonium and Bottomonium decays \$[s{\textbackslash}overline\{s\}]\$, \$[c{\textbackslash}overline\{c\}]\$ and \$[b{\textbackslash}overline\{b\}]{\textbackslash}rightarrow X {\textbackslash}pi{\textasciicircum}-{\textbackslash}pi{\textasciicircum}- e{\textasciicircum}+e{\textasciicircum}+{\textasciitilde}+{\textasciitilde}hc\$ with \$X\$ invisible at KLOE, CLEOc, BESIII, Belle and BaBar.},
