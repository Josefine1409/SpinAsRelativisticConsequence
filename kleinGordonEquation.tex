\chapter{The Klein-Gordon Equation}
The approach is to find a Schr√∂dinger-like equation by replacing the non-relativistic energy with that of a relativistic particle, but otherwise do as normal. Considering a free particle with momentum with momentum $p = |\mathbf{p}|$ and invariant mass $m_0$, the relativistic energy is \cite[eq.~12.34]{uggerhoj_speciel_2016}
\begin{align}
	E &= \sqrt{(\v{p}c)^2 + \left(m_0c^2\right)^2} \: .
\end{align}
A Hamiltonian with the above eigenenergy when applied to a momentum-eigenstate $\ket{\mathbf{p}}$ with eigenvalue $\mathbf{p}$ must be found, \cite[chap.~8.1]{sakurai_modern_2011}, but the square root turns out to be a problem in the early efforts to derive a relativistic equation, since the way of of dealing with the square root is via a Taylor expansion,
\begin{align}
	H &= \sqrt{\v{p}^2c^2 + m_0^2c^4}	
	= m_0c^2 \left[1+\frac{\v{p}^2}{m_0^2c^2}\right]^{\frac{1}{2}}
	= m_0c^2 + \frac{\v{p}^2}{2m_0} - \frac{\v{p}^4}{8m_0^3} + \frac{\v{p}^6}{16m_0^5} + \dots \: .
\end{align}
This, though, yields a non-covariant wave equation, since the time derivative from \cref{eq:OverordnetStrukturAfQMLigning} will be associated with different order spacial derivatives, which is not desirable.


\section{Derivation of the Klein-Gordon Equation}
To avoid these problems first attempts to find a relativistic wave equation used the square of the Hamiltonian, hence the square of the energy, instead of the Hamiltonian, and the energy, itself,
\begin{align} \label{eq:KleinGordon_EnergySquared}
	E^2 &= (\v{p}c)^2 + \left(m_0c^2\right)^2 \: .
\end{align}
Using the operator representations of $E$ and $\v{p}$ from \cref{Schrodinger_ClassicalToQuantumMechanics_E_p}, and letting it operate on the wave function of a particle \cref{eq:KleinGordon_EnergySquared} becomes
\begin{align}
	-\hbar^2 \pdiff{t}\Psi(\v{r},t) &= -\hbar^2c^2\nabla^2\Psi(\v{r},t) + m_0^2c^4\Psi(\v{r},t) \: ,
\end{align}
which is know as the Klein-Gordon equation.

The Klein-Gordon equation satisfy nearly all of the desirable qualities of a relativistic wave equation. Firstly it is covariant which a relativistic equation shall be, as stated in \cref{chap:SchrodingerEquation}.

Solutions that we would expect

Conservation of probability

But then the problems are encountered. Probability not positive definite.


\section{Problems}

REMEMBER TO WRITE SOMETHING LIKE THIS, BUT NOT JUST THIS SINCE IT'S DIRECTLY FROM SAKURAI: There will be solutions to the wave equation with negative energies; these solutions are necessary to form a complete set of basis states, but they have no obvious physical meaning.
